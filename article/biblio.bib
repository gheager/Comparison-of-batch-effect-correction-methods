    abstract = "{Motivation: Batch effects are due to probe-specific systematic variation between groups of samples (batches) resulting from experimental features that are not of biological interest. Principal component analysis (PCA) is commonly used as a visual tool to determine whether batch effects exist after applying a global normalization method. However, PCA yields linear combinations of the variables that contribute maximum variance and thus will not necessarily detect batch effects if they are not the largest source of variability in the data.Results: We present an extension of PCA to quantify the existence of batch effects, called guided PCA (gPCA). We describe a test statistic that uses gPCA to test whether a batch effect exists. We apply our proposed test statistic derived using gPCA to simulated data and to two copy number variation case studies: the first study consisted of 614 samples from a breast cancer family study using Illumina Human 660 bead-chip arrays, whereas the second case study consisted of 703 samples from a family blood pressure study that used Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0. We demonstrate that our statistic has good statistical properties and is able to identify significant batch effects in two copy number variation case studies.Conclusion: We developed a new statistic that uses gPCA to identify whether batch effects exist in high-throughput genomic data. Although our examples pertain to copy number data, gPCA is general and can be used on other data types as well.Availability and implementation: The gPCA R package (Available via CRAN) provides functionality and data to perform the methods in this article.Contact:reesese@vcu.edu or eckel@mayo.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

It consists of selected microarray and RNA-sequencing studies from ArrayExpress, which have been manually curated, annotated with ontology terms, checked for high quality and processed using standardised analysis methods. Since the last update, Atlas has grown seven-fold (1572 studies as of August 2015), and incorporates baseline expression profiles of tissues from Human Protein Atlas, GTEx and FANTOM5, and of cancer cell lines from ENCODE, CCLE and Genentech projects. Plant studies constitute a quarter of Atlas data. For genes of interest, the user can view baseline expression in tissues, and differential expression for biologically meaningful pairwise comparisons—estimated using consistent methodology across all of Atlas. Our first proteomics study in human tissues is now displayed alongside transcriptomics data in the same tissues. Novel analyses and visualisations include: ‘enrichment’ in each differential comparison of GO terms, Reactome, Plant Reactome pathways and InterPro domains; hierarchical clustering (by baseline expression) of most variable genes and experimental conditions; and, for a given gene-condition, distribution of baseline expression across biological replicates.}",

	abstract = {Increasing numbers of large scale single cell RNA-Seq projects are leading to a data explosion, which can only be fully exploited through data integration. Therefore, efficient computational tools for combining diverse datasets are crucial for biology in the single cell genomics era. A number of methods have been developed to assist data integration by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration method. We illustrate the power of BBKNN for dimensionalityreduced visualisation and clustering in multiple biological scenarios, including a massive integrative study over several murine atlases. BBKNN successfully connects cell populations across experimentally heterogeneous mouse scRNA-Seq datasets, which reveals global markers of cell type and organspecificity and provides the foundation for inferring the underlying transcription factor network.
